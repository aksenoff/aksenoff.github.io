This page is supposed to be about me. But I don't feel like filling it. This is why the page is created, but has no info. What an awkward situation.

Furthermore, it is considered rude and indecent to praise yourself. And if I start to fill this page, I would have to praise myself, because I am so awesome. Yikes, I did it again.

You've been reading this for too long. If you have some more time to lose, consider visiting [my website](http://aksenov.tk).
